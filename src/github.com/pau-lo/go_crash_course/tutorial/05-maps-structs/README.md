- Maps
    - Collections of value types that are accessed via keys
    - created via literals or vai make function
    - members accessed via [key] syntax
    - check for presence with "value, ok" form of result
    - multiple assignment refer to same underlying data

- Structs
    - Collections of disparate data types that describe a single concept
    - keyed by named fields
    - normally created as types, but anonymous structs are allowed
    - structs are value types
    - no inheritance, but can use composition vai embedding
    - tags can be added to struct fields to describe fields
